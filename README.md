# 9318NER
NER project.

This project was for COMP9318 Data Warehousing & Data Mining, using scikit-learn and python 3.
Goal of the task was as follows:

Named Entity Recognition. The goal of Named Entity Recognition (NER) is to
locate segments of text from input document and classify them in one of the pre-defined
categories (e.g., PERSON, LOCATION, and ORGNIZATION). In this project, you only need to
perform NER for a single category of TITLE. We define a TITLE as an appellation associated
with a person by virtue of occupation, office, birth, or as an honorific. For example, in the
following sentence, both Prime Minister and MP are TITLEs.
